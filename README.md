# Microservices


## ✅ What is **Microservices** Architecture?

**Microservices** is an architectural style where an application is **broken down into small, independent services**, each responsible for a specific business capability.

**Microservices is an architectural approach to developing a single application as a suite of small, independent services.** Each service runs in its own process, communicates through lightweight mechanisms (such as HTTP or messaging), is centered around a specific business capability, and can be deployed independently using fully automated deployment pipelines.

### 🔹 Key Features:

* Each service runs in its **own process**
* Services **communicate** via APIs (usually REST, gRPC, or messaging)
* **Decentralized** development, deployment, and scaling
* Each service can use its own **database and tech stack**
* Promotes **agility**, **scalability**, and **resilience**

### 🔹 Example:

An e-commerce app might be split into:

* **Product Service**
* **Order Service**
* **Payment Service**
* **User Service**

---

## ✅ What is a **Monolithic** Architecture?

A **monolithic application** is built as a **single, large unit** where all functionalities are tightly coupled and run in one process.

### 🔹 Key Characteristics:

* All components (UI, business logic, data access) are in **one codebase**
* **One build** and **one deployment**
* Hard to scale individual parts
* **Tightly coupled** – a change in one part can affect the whole system

### 🔹 Example:

An e-commerce app where product, order, payment, and user logic all exist in one Spring Boot application.

---

## ✅ What is **SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)**?

**SOA** is an architectural pattern where applications are built as a **collection of services**, but these services typically share a **common infrastructure** like:

* **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)**
* **Centralized governance and security**

### 🔹 Differences from Microservices:

| Feature       | SOA                                  | Microservices                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Communication | ESB (heavy, centralized)             | REST, lightweight messaging          |
| Coupling      | Loosely coupled, but often shared DB | Fully independent, often private DBs |
| Deployment    | Often deployed together              | Independently deployable             |
| Granularity   | Coarse-grained services              | Fine-grained, focused services       |

---

## 🔁 Summary

| Architecture      | Description                                            | Pros                                 | Cons                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Monolithic**    | All-in-one app with tightly coupled components         | Simple to build & deploy             | Hard to scale, slow to update  |
| **SOA**           | Distributed services using shared infrastructure (ESB) | Promotes reuse                       | Can be complex and heavyweight |
| **Microservices** | Small, independently deployable services               | Scalable, resilient, faster delivery | Complex DevOps & communication |


## ✅ Why **Spring Boot** for Microservices?

Spring Boot is widely regarded as one of the **best frameworks** for building microservices due to its **simplicity, power, and rich ecosystem**. Here's why:

---

### 🔹 1. **Self-Contained Deployable JARs (Fat JARs)**

* Traditional applications were deployed as **WARs** and required **external servers** like Tomcat or JBoss.
* Spring Boot packages applications as **standalone JARs** with:

  * Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow)
  * All required dependencies
* This enables each microservice to run **independently** on any machine with a JVM—ideal for microservice architecture.

---

### 🔹 2. **Auto-Configuration and Rapid Setup**

* Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code with **auto-configuration**.
* With a few annotations and **starter dependencies**, you can:

  * Connect to databases
  * Secure endpoints
  * Configure queues, schedulers, etc.
* Speeds up development and avoids repetitive manual setup.

---

### 🔹 3. **Built-in Support for Production-Ready Features**

* Integrated **Actuator** module provides:

  * Health checks
  * Metrics
  * Logging
  * Application info endpoints
* Useful for **monitoring and maintaining** microservices in production environments.

---

### 🔹 4. **Externalized Configuration**

* Easily externalize properties using:

  * `application.properties` or `.yml`
  * Command-line arguments
  * Environment variables
* Makes microservices **portable** and easy to configure per environment (dev, test, prod).

---

### 🔹 5. **Cloud-Native Friendly**

* Spring Boot integrates well with cloud platforms and tools:

  * Kubernetes
  * Docker
  * Spring Cloud
* Enables service discovery, centralized configuration, circuit breakers, distributed tracing, and more.

---

### 🔹 6. **Microservice Starter Ecosystem**

* Spring Boot provides **pre-configured starter dependencies**:

  * `spring-boot-starter-web` for REST APIs
  * `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` for database access
  * `spring-boot-starter-security` for security
* These starters simplify setup for commonly used features.

---

### 🔹 7. **Scalable Architecture Support**

* Spring Boot is **modular**, making it easy to break functionality into **separate microservices**.
* Works seamlessly with tools like:

  * Eureka (Service Discovery)
  * Zuul/Gateway (Routing)
  * Config Server (Externalized Config)
  * Sleuth & Zipkin (Distributed Tracing)

---

## 🔁 Summary: WAR vs JAR Deployment

| Traditional (WAR)                      | Microservices with Spring Boot (JAR)  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Requires external server               | Includes embedded server              |
| Heavier and tightly coupled deployment | Lightweight, modular services         |
| Harder to scale and maintain           | Scalable and independently deployable |




## ✅ **1. Externalizing Configurations in Spring Boot**

Spring Boot allows you to **externalize application configuration** to make your apps flexible and environment-agnostic. These external sources override values in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

---

### 🔹 A. **Using Command-Line Arguments**

**Syntax:**

```bash
java -jar app.jar --property.name=value
```

**Example:**

```bash
java -jar accounts-service.jar --build.version=1.1
```

* Spring Boot automatically maps this to `build.version=1.1`.
* **Precedence:** Highest among all property sources.
* **Use Case:** Temporary overrides, quick deployments, CI/CD pipelines.

---

### 🔹 B. **Using JVM System Properties**

**Syntax:**

```bash
java -Dproperty.name=value -jar app.jar
```

**Example:**

```bash
java -Dbuild.version=1.2 -jar accounts-service.jar
```

* Mapped directly to Spring's `Environment` object.
* **Precedence:** Lower than CLI arguments, but higher than environment variables and property files.

---

### 🔹 C. **Using Environment Variables**

**Syntax:**

```bash
# Windows
set BUILD_VERSION=1.3
java -jar accounts-service.jar

# Linux/macOS
BUILD_VERSION=1.3 java -jar accounts-service.jar
```

**Mapping Rules (Relaxed Binding):**

* Property name: `build.version`
* Environment Variable: `BUILD_VERSION`

Spring Boot converts:

* Dots (`.`) and hyphens (`-`) to underscores (`_`)
* Lowercase to uppercase

**Precedence:** Lower than CLI and JVM args, but higher than `application.properties`.

---

### 🔹 D. **Using `application.properties` or `application.yml`**

**Example:**

```properties
build.version=1.0
```

This is the **default configuration** within your application.

---

## 📊 **Spring Boot Property Precedence Order (Highest to Lowest)**

1. **Command-line arguments** (`--build.version=1.1`)
2. **JVM system properties** (`-Dbuild.version=1.2`)
3. **Environment variables** (`BUILD_VERSION=1.3`)
4. **Application properties file**
5. **Default properties**

---

## ❗ Problems with Manual External Configuration (Spring Boot Alone)

1. **Manual Setup & Human Errors**

   * Manually setting CLI args, env vars, or JVM options can lead to mistakes in deployments.

2. **No Revision History**

   * Changing `application.properties` or env vars leaves **no audit trail**.

3. **Lack of Access Control**

   * Env vars can't control **who can read/change** configs.

4. **Scaling Issues**

   * Managing configs for **100+ instances** is hard without centralized config.

5. **No Encryption**

   * Secrets in `application.properties`, env vars, etc., are in **plain text**.

6. **Dynamic Config Reload**

   * Changing a config requires a **restart** unless you add dynamic refresh logic.

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Solutions for Enterprise Applications

### ✅ **1. Centralized Configuration with Spring Cloud Config**

* Store configs in **Git**, **Vault**, **File System**, or **DB**.
* Clients fetch their configuration from a **central config server**.
* Allows **versioning**, rollback, and easy updates.

> ✅ Use `@RefreshScope` for beans to auto-refresh on config changes.

---

### ✅ **2. Secrets Management with Vault**

* Use **HashiCorp Vault**, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.
* Spring Boot integrates with **Spring Cloud Vault**:

  * Secure storage.
  * Fine-grained access.
  * Encrypted secrets.

```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    vault:
      uri: http://localhost:8200
      token: s.xxxxxxxx
```

---

### ✅ **3. Dynamic Refresh with Actuator + Spring Cloud Bus**

* Use Spring Actuator to expose `POST /actuator/refresh`.
* Trigger a **refresh event** using Spring Cloud Bus (RabbitMQ/Kafka) to notify all instances.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
```

> Only works with properties marked using `@RefreshScope`.

---

### ✅ **4. Audit & Access Control**

* Store configuration in **version-controlled systems** like Git.
* Use CI/CD pipelines to control **who can change** what.
* Log configuration load events for audit trails.

---

### ✅ **5. Use Profiles for Environment Separation**

```bash
java -jar app.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
```

* Separate files like:

  * `application-dev.properties`
  * `application-prod.properties`

Here's a **clean and structured explanation** of how **Spring Cloud Config** helps with centralized configuration in microservices:

---

## ✅ What is **Spring Cloud Config**?

**Spring Cloud Config** is a framework that provides **server and client-side support** for managing **externalized configuration** in a **centralized, versioned, and secure** way for distributed systems (microservices).

---

## 🔄 Why Centralized Configuration?

In a microservices architecture:

* Each service runs independently.
* Configurations vary by environment (dev, test, prod).
* Managing config across multiple services manually becomes error-prone and inefficient.

---

## 🔧 Spring Cloud Config Architecture

### 🔹 1. **Central Repository** (e.g., Git, SVN, File System)

* Stores configuration files (like `application.yml`, `service-name.yml`)
* Supports **version control**, **access control**, and **history tracking**
* Example:

  ```
  config-repo/
    ├── application.yml
    ├── accounts-service.yml
    └── loans-service.yml
  ```

### 🔹 2. **Spring Cloud Config Server**

* Acts as a **middle layer** between microservices and the configuration source.
* Fetches properties from the central repo and serves them to client applications via REST endpoints.
* Example endpoint:

  ```
  GET /{application}/{profile}
  /accounts-service/dev → returns dev config for accounts-service
  ```

### 🔹 3. **Spring Cloud Config Clients**

* Microservices act as **Config clients**
* At startup, they contact the **Config Server** to fetch their configurations.
* Uses bootstrap configuration (`bootstrap.yml` or `bootstrap.properties`) to connect to the Config Server.

---

## 📦 Configuration Flow

```plaintext
Microservices (Clients)
     ↓ fetch config
Config Server
     ↓ load from repo
Central Config Repository (Git/File System)
```

---

## ✅ Key Benefits

| Feature                         | Benefit                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centralized Management**      | One place to manage config for all services across environments         |
| **Versioned Configuration**     | Use Git/SVN for history, rollback, auditing                             |
| **Environment Specific Config** | Supports profiles like `dev`, `test`, `prod`                            |
| **Secure Config Delivery**      | Config server can be secured with Spring Security + encrypted values    |
| **Dynamic Refreshing**          | With `@RefreshScope` and Spring Bus, some configs can be refreshed live |

---

## ✅ Example `bootstrap.yml` (Client Side)

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: accounts-service
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
      profile: dev
```

---

## ✅ Example Repo Structure

```
config-repo/
  ├── application.yml                 # Global config
  ├── accounts-service.yml           # Service-specific config
  └── accounts-service-dev.yml       # Environment-specific config
```

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

Using **Spring Cloud Config** for centralized configuration solves the key problems of:

* Manual property management
* Environment inconsistencies
* Lack of config versioning and auditing
* Inability to dynamically update config without restarting apps

It brings scalability, maintainability, and control to distributed microservice architectures.

Here are well-structured notes on **refreshing Spring Cloud Config at runtime** using `/actuator/refresh` along with **code snippets** and explanations. It also addresses **scaling to multiple instances** in production.

---

## 🔁 Refreshing Config at Runtime in Spring Cloud

### ✅ Goal:

Enable dynamic configuration updates in a Spring Boot microservice using the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint **without restarting the service**.

---

## 🔧 1. Add Spring Boot Actuator Dependency (in Client Service)

**pom.xml** (for `accounts`, `loans`, `cards`, etc.):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

## ⚙️ 2. Enable `/actuator/refresh` Endpoint

**application.yml** (in microservice):

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: refresh  # expose only the refresh endpoint
```

---

## 📤 3. Trigger Refresh via HTTP POST

Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
```

➡️ This will:

* Reload the configuration properties
* Pull the latest config from the Config Server
* Apply the changes live, without restarting

---

## 🔄 Refresh Flow Diagram Summary

1. **Developer pushes new config** ➝ Git Config Repo
2. **Config Server detects change** (on next request)
3. **Microservice manually or programmatically calls** `/actuator/refresh`
4. **Config Server fetches latest config**
5. **Client microservice reloads properties dynamically**

---

## 🧪 Example

**Updated config in Git repo:**

```yaml
message: "Hello from production!"
```

**Refresh via POST:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
```

**Access updated property:**

```java
@RefreshScope
@RestController
public class MessageController {

    @Value("${message}")
    private String message;

    @GetMapping("/message")
    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}
```

🔁 `@RefreshScope` is essential to re-initialize the bean with updated properties.


### 🌐 What is **Spring Cloud Bus**?

**Spring Cloud Bus** is a Spring Cloud component used to **broadcast events** (like configuration changes) to multiple instances of microservices using a **message broker** such as **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**.

---

## 🔑 Key Purpose

In a distributed system with multiple microservice instances, when configuration changes occur (e.g., in Spring Cloud Config), it's inefficient to manually refresh every instance.
**Spring Cloud Bus** solves this by **automatically propagating** events (like `/refresh`) to all connected services **over the message broker**.

---

## ✅ Main Features

| Feature                          | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔄 Dynamic Configuration Refresh | Propagates config updates to all services using `/actuator/busrefresh` |
| 📨 Event Broadcasting            | Sends custom or system events to all nodes via RabbitMQ/Kafka          |
| 🧩 Lightweight Integration       | Plugs into Spring Boot Actuator and Spring Cloud Config easily         |
| ⚙️ Works with Message Brokers    | Supports **RabbitMQ**, **Kafka**, etc.                                 |

---

## 🛠️ How It Works (In Brief)

1. You update a config value in your Git repo.
2. Push it to the remote repo (e.g., GitHub).
3. Call `POST /actuator/busrefresh` on **any one** microservice.
4. Spring Cloud Bus uses RabbitMQ to send a **refresh event** to **all services**.
5. All services reload updated configuration dynamically.

---

## 📦 Typical Stack

* **Spring Cloud Config Server**
* **Spring Cloud Config Clients** (Accounts, Loans, etc.)
* **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka** (as the transport layer)
* **Spring Boot Actuator**
* **Spring Cloud Bus**

---

## 📘 Example Scenario

Let's say you have:

* 3 microservices (Accounts, Loans, Cards)
* Central config in GitHub (Spring Cloud Config)
* Config Server running
* RabbitMQ running

After pushing a config change:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/busrefresh
```

🔁 All three services automatically reload the updated config — **no restart needed**.

---

## 🚫 Without Spring Cloud Bus

You would have to:

* Call `/actuator/refresh` **on each instance manually**, or
* Restart each app

✅ Spring Cloud Bus removes that pain by **centralizing the refresh process**.

---


## 🧩 Architecture Overview

```
     ┌────────────────┐           ┌────────────────┐
     │ Config Repo    │  Push     │ Config Server  │
     │ (GitHub)       ├──────────►│ (Spring Cloud) │
     └────────────────┘           └────────────────┘

           └───── Message Broker (RabbitMQ) ─────┘
```

---

## ✅ How it works

1. Configuration is stored in a **Git repository**.
2. **Spring Cloud Config Server** fetches the latest configuration.
3. On triggering `/actuator/busrefresh`, a **refresh event is sent via RabbitMQ**.
4. All microservices receive this event and re-bind their `@RefreshScope` beans with the new configuration.

---

## 📦 Step-by-Step Setup

---

### ✅ 1. Add Required Dependencies

Add the following dependencies in **`pom.xml`** of:

* Config Server
* All microservices (Accounts, Loans, Cards)

```xml
<!-- Spring Boot Actuator for exposing refresh endpoints -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- Spring Cloud Bus with RabbitMQ -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

### ✅ 2. Expose the `/busrefresh` Endpoint

By default, `/actuator/busrefresh` is not exposed. You must explicitly include it in the YAML config:

**application.yml (for all services and config server):**

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: busrefresh
```

To expose all endpoints (used commonly in dev/test environments):

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: "*"
```

---

### ✅ 3. Run RabbitMQ via Docker

You can start a RabbitMQ instance using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --hostname rabbitmq-host --name rabbitmq \
  -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 \
  rabbitmq:3-management
```

* Web UI: [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)
* Default credentials: `guest` / `guest`

---

### ✅ 4. Configure RabbitMQ in Application YML

**All services and config server must include RabbitMQ details:**

```yaml
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 5672
    username: "guest"
    password: "guest"
```

---

### ✅ 5. Config Server Full Configuration (As Provided)

```yaml
spring:

### ✅ 6. Use `@RefreshScope` for Dynamic Beans

Use `@RefreshScope` on beans whose values should refresh without restart:

```java
@RefreshScope
@RestController
public class MessageController {

    @Value("${message}")
    private String message;

    @GetMapping("/message")
    public String getMessage() {
        return message;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ 7. Trigger Refresh Event Manually

Trigger this using a POST request to any one microservice:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/busrefresh
```

This will:

* Fetch the updated configuration from Git
* Broadcast refresh event via RabbitMQ
* Reload `@RefreshScope` beans in all microservices

---

## ⚡ BONUS: Fully Automate with GitHub Webhook

To **automate the config refresh after every Git push**, follow these steps:

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Add an API to Trigger `/busrefresh`

```java
@RestController
public class AutoRefreshController {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    @PostMapping("/webhook/refresh")
    public ResponseEntity<String> autoRefresh() {
        restTemplate.postForObject("http://localhost:8080/actuator/busrefresh", null, String.class);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Config refresh triggered");
    }
}
```

---

### 🌐 Step 2: Create GitHub Webhook

* Go to your GitHub repo (e.g., `eazybytes-config`)
* Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook**
* Payload URL: `http://<your-host>:<port>/webhook/refresh`
* Content type: `application/json`
* Trigger on: `Just the push event`

✅ Now, **every push to GitHub** will automatically trigger a refresh of all microservices.

##**automatically refresh Spring Cloud Config properties at runtime** using **Spring Cloud Bus** and **Spring Cloud Config Monitor**:

## 🧩 Components Involved:

* **Spring Cloud Config Server**
* **Spring Cloud Config Clients** (Accounts, Loans, Cards)
* **Spring Cloud Bus** (backed by RabbitMQ)
* **Spring Cloud Config Monitor**
* **RabbitMQ** (for broadcasting config change events)
* **GitHub Webhook** (to notify Config Server on config updates)

---

## 🔁 How It Works – Step-by-Step:

### **1. Add Required Dependencies**

#### ✅ In all microservices & config server (`pom.xml`):

```xml
<!-- Spring Boot Actuator -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

<!-- Spring Cloud Bus for AMQP (RabbitMQ) -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-bus-amqp</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### ✅ In **Config Server only**:

```xml
<!-- Spring Cloud Config Monitor -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-monitor</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

### **2. Enable `/actuator/busrefresh` and `/monitor` endpoints**

#### ✅ In all microservices & config server (`application.yml`):

```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: busrefresh,refresh,health,info
```

---

### **3. Add Spring Cloud Bus and RabbitMQ configuration**

#### ✅ `application.yml` (Config Server & Clients):

```yaml
spring:
  rabbitmq:
    host: localhost
    port: 5672
    username: guest
    password: guest
```

---

### **4. Setup RabbitMQ via Docker (if not already)**

#### 🐳 Docker command:

```bash
docker run -d --hostname rabbit --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

Access UI at: `http://localhost:15672`
(Default user/pass: `guest` / `guest`)

---

### **5. Push Config Changes to GitHub**

* Update your config files (e.g., `accounts.yml`, `loans.yml`) in your GitHub repository.

---

### **6. Create a GitHub Webhook**

1. Go to your GitHub config repo → **Settings** → **Webhooks**
2. Click **Add Webhook**
3. Use the following configuration:

   * **Payload URL**: `http://localhost:8071/monitor` (your config server's address)
   * **Content type**: `application/json`
   * **Event**: Push events
   * Click **Add webhook**

---

### **7. Monitor Endpoint Triggered Automatically**

Once the GitHub webhook hits `/monitor` on the Config Server:

* Spring Cloud Config Monitor detects the config repo change
* Publishes an event to RabbitMQ
* **Spring Cloud Bus** propagates the event
* All microservices receive a **refresh signal**
* Updated configuration is fetched without restarting any app

---

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

| Step | What Happens                                   | Component                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1    | You commit config changes to GitHub            | GitHub                      |
| 2    | Webhook sends POST to `/monitor`               | GitHub                      |
| 3    | Config Server receives the event               | Spring Cloud Config Monitor |
| 4    | Publishes refresh event to RabbitMQ            | Spring Cloud Bus            |
| 5    | All client microservices receive `/busrefresh` | Spring Cloud Bus            |
| 6    | Clients fetch the latest config dynamically    | Spring Cloud Config Clients |

---

## ✅ Final Outcome:

✅ **No manual trigger**
✅ **All instances updated instantly**
✅ **Zero downtime**
✅ **Centralized config with live propagation**

Certainly! Below is the same `application.yml` file for the **Accounts microservice**, now with detailed **inline comments** explaining each section:

```yaml
# Server configuration: Specifies the port where the Accounts microservice will run
server:
  port: 8080

# Spring application configuration
spring:
  application:
    # Name of the application, used for Spring Cloud Config to load the relevant config files (e.g., accounts.yml)
    name: "accounts"

  profiles:
    # Active profile for the application. It specifies which profile to use when fetching configuration from the Config Server.
    active: "prod"  # In this case, 'prod' profile will be used to load 'accounts-prod.yml' from the config repo.

  # Data source configuration for the Accounts microservice.
  datasource:
    # H2 in-memory database configuration for testing/development purposes.
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driverClassName: org.h2.Driver
    username: sa
    password: ''  # Empty password for the H2 database

  # Enable the H2 console for accessing the database via browser for testing.
  h2:
    console:
      enabled: true

  # JPA (Java Persistence API) configuration for Hibernate, enabling automatic DB schema updates and SQL logging.
  jpa:
    # Defines the Hibernate dialect for H2 database
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update  # Automatically updates the DB schema (for testing/dev purposes)
    show-sql: true  # Logs all SQL queries for debugging

  # Spring Cloud Config integration, importing configuration from the Config Server
  config:
    # The Config Server URI where the configuration will be fetched from.
    # The "optional:" prefix ensures that the application will not crash if the Config Server is temporarily unavailable.
    import: "optional:configserver:http://localhost:8071/"  # Config Server running at localhost on port 8071

  # RabbitMQ configuration for Spring Cloud Bus integration
  rabbitmq:
    # Connection details for RabbitMQ message broker, used to broadcast refresh events to all connected microservices.
    host: "localhost"  # RabbitMQ host
    port: 5672  # Default RabbitMQ port
    username: "guest"  # Default username for RabbitMQ
    password: "guest"  # Default password for RabbitMQ

# Management endpoint configuration (for Spring Boot Actuator)
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      # Exposing all actuator endpoints for management and monitoring purposes.
      exposure:
        include: "*"  # Exposing all endpoints like /actuator/health, /actuator/refresh, /actuator/busrefresh
```

### 🧩 **Key Sections Explained**:

1. **Server Configuration**: The microservice is set to run on port `8080`.

2. **Spring Application Settings**:

   * Defines the service name as `"accounts"`, which helps **Spring Cloud Config** fetch the right configuration file (e.g., `accounts.yml`) from the repository.
   * The active profile is set to `prod`, which indicates that the service will use the configuration related to the `prod` profile.

3. **Datasource and JPA Configuration**:

   * Configures an **H2 database** to be used during development/testing.
   * Enables **automatic schema updates** and logs SQL queries for easy debugging.

4. **Spring Cloud Config**:

   * Configures the microservice to **fetch external configurations from the Config Server** running on `http://localhost:8071`. The `optional:` prefix ensures that the application doesn't fail if the Config Server is temporarily unavailable.

5. **RabbitMQ Configuration**:

   * Configures the **RabbitMQ connection** to facilitate communication through **Spring Cloud Bus**, which helps propagate configuration changes across all microservices. It listens to events like `RefreshRemoteApplicationEvent` to reload the configuration.

6. **Management Endpoints**:

   * Exposes all **Spring Boot Actuator endpoints**, such as `/actuator/busrefresh`, which is crucial for triggering the refresh event when **Spring Cloud Bus** broadcasts it across the network.

---

This configuration enables your microservice to leverage **Spring Cloud Config**, **Spring Cloud Bus**, and **Spring Cloud Config Monitor** for dynamic, hot-reloadable configuration changes across multiple microservices in a production environment.
